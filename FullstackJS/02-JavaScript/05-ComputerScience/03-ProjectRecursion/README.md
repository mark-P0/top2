# Project: Recursion

A separate repo was not created for this "project".

Instead, solutions were placed on the same directory as this README.

Named "testing" blocks were specifically formatted for use with the [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) extension in VSCode (_also has limited availability in other text editors_).

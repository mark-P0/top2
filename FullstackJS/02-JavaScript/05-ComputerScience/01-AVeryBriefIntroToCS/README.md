# A Very Brief Intro to CS

## Knowledge Check

- What is an Algorithm?

  - Set of instructions that compose a procedure
  - The procedure describes an effect that is desired to achieve

- What is the importance of algorithms in web development?

  - Well-engineered algorithms produce deterministic results in an optimized, elegant, and readable manner
  - This directly translates to...
    - Improved user experience (UX);
    - Reduced costs, e.g. storage, computing;
    - Increase in opportunities for profit
  - It can be argued that, in web development, one can get away with not developing such sophisticated algorithms from scratch
    - Rely on existing optimized applications
    - "Do not reinvent the wheel"-ish
  - But the concepts for developing such algorithms are surely most useful, e.g.
    - Optimized loops
    - Avoid creating one-off arrays
  - Equally important to identify and avoid **pre-mature optimizations**
  - Similar to "_why learn math/algebra/trigonometry if it does not get used in real life?_"
    - The critical thinking skills developed along the way will prove useful
    - If nurtured properly

- What is pseudocode?

  - English-like outline of an algorithm in terms of programming concepts

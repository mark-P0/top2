# Introduction to Responsive Design

- Create websites such that they properly _respond_ to changes in browser size
- So that it may be viewed from any form factor of any device
- Responsiveness does not work automatically
  - Some say that websites are responsive _by default_, and that the layout detracts from this
  - It is the basis of mobile-first design

## Screen sizes

### Smallest could be `320px`

- The smallest phones are rarely smaller than `320px`

### Highest could be arbitrary

- Decide on a `max-width` and center the content within it

# The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

> In implementing accessibility, it is important to remember that:
>
> - **No site can be 100% accessible.**
> - Making even a fraction of the site accessible already goes a long way.

## Principles

### Perceivable

- Can be seen by anyone

### Operable

- Can be used by anyone
- Does not rely on a specific tool, e.g.
  - Mouse for on-hover effects
  - Keyboard for toggling focus

### Understandable

- Can be understood by anyone
- Human-readable
- No tech jargon

### Robust

- Can be parsed by accessibility tools, e.g.
  - Screen readers

## Conformance Levels

> Achieving more specialized levels also achieves the levels before them

### A

- Essential support
- Minimal compliance

### AA

- Ideal support
- Strived for by most organizations

### AAA

- Specialized support
- Not recommended
- May be impossible to achieve for some sites due to the nature of their content

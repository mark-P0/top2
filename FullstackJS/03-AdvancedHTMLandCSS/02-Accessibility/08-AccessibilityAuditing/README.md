# Accessibility Auditing

## Built-in

- **Accessibility Tree** in Chrome DevTools
  - `Elements` tab
  - `Accessibility` sub-tab (along with e.g. `Styles`, `Computed`, `Layout`)
  - View a stripped-down version of the DOM with only the accessibility-related information
  - _Optionally_, tick `Enable full-page accessibility tree` to show a toggle between the DOM and Accessibility Tree in the main DOM viewer itself

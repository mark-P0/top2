## Non-Semantic Elements

## [Examples of] Semantic Elements

### `<p>`

### `<button>`

- Indicates an interactive element that can be clicked to achieve a particular effect

### `<table>`

- Indicates a tabular data for better parsing

### Labelled inputs

- Provides additional context for `<input>` elements
- As a sibling relationship. Requires `id`
  ```html
  <label for="name">Name</label> <input type="text" id="name" />
  ```
- As a nested relationship
  ```html
  <label>
    Name
    <input type="text" />
  </label>
  ```

### `<input>` types

- Use the closest, most appropriate `type`
- Devices could provide a specialized input field for certain `type`

### Lists

- A collection of related items must should be within a list
- Items should be set as `<li>`
- Items should be within either `<ol>` or `<ul>`
  - Most likely `<ul>`

## Leftover questions

### When to escape/unescape data?

```
- clone mdn finished example
- link to database `local-library-mdn`
- try to run it
- try to add data with escaped outputs, e.g. "Pride and Prejudice" "Tom and Sally's Big Adventures"
- Check if they render escaped data
```

It seems like a pretty loaded question but I don't know how to put it in a better way

- escape inputs before saving to database, then unescape on output?
  - Won't that allow injecting as well?
- only escape on output?

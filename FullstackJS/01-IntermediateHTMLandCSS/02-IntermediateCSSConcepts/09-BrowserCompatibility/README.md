## Why care about Safari?

I used to disregard Safari as a browser, thinking that _nobody uses the built-in browser_, I feel like everyone is using Chrome, even on iOS devices. Just like how no one is using Internet Explorer and/or Edge in Windows in favor of Chrome.

> For the record, I use Firefox on both mobile and desktop.

However, apparently, even if Chrome and Firefox exists on the iOS app store, they still use Safari's engine underneath. They are essentially skinned versions of Safari.

Suddenly, Safari is more important in my mind now.

## Knowledge Check

- What is the most used browser currently?

  - Chrome.
  - Specifically, Chromium.
  - Nearly every major browsers are just a derivative of Chromium.
  - Chrome itself is based on Chromium.
  - Therefore, every single one of them is just an extension of Chromium.
  - For development, it would be best to at the very least ensure that the application works properly on a Chromium browser, e.g. Google Chrome.

- What was the original name of the first web browser?

  - _WorldWideWeb_

- How are mobile browsers different on Apple mobile operating systems from Android?

  - There are multiple browsers for Android
    - In a similar vein as to how there are multiple browsers for desktop platforms
  - There is effectively only a single browser on iOS: Safari
    - Chrome and Firefox exists on the app store, but they all use Safari underneath
    - As mandated by Apple (_yikes..._)

      My first attempt was to use `justify-content` to add spaces between the list flex items
      However, this does not work, and I can't figure out why
      I remembered `gap` as an alternative, and sure enough it does work

      Another way is to add margins around the list items, and remove the header padding
      But there is no declared `li` selector, and so this approach was not used

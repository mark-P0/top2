1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line

   > If applied, this commit will your `subject line here`

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

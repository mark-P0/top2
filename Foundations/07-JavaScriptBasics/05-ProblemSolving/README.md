# Problem Solving

## Steps in solving a problem

### 1. Understand the problem

- **Reframe** the problem
- Rewrite in **plain english**
- Outline, visualize the **desired outputs**
- **Draw** diagrams, doodles, tables, etc.

### 2. Plan for the solution

- Ask and answer some questions:
  - How would the solution be **presented**?
    - User interface?
    - Console?
  - What will be the **inputs**?
  - What will be the **outputs**?
  - How can the inputs be **translated** into output?
    - _Pseudocode_
- Outline the plan in **pseudocode**
  - Code but in plain english
  - Provides the logic
  - Step-by-step procedures

### 3. Divide and conquer

- Identify parts of the program
  - As outlined in the plan
  - Translation from inputs to outputs may have one or several parts
  - Several inputs may be processed to produce the needed output
- Work on each part one-by-one
- Connect them all together to provide the problem solution

## Knowledge Check

- What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

  - Understand
  - Plan
  - Divide (and conquer)

- Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

  - You won't be able to verify the "solution" you'll create if you don't understand how it relates to the problem
  - Understanding the problem would allow for more efficient, logical, and concise solutions

- What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

  - Break it down to its constituents
  - Reframe it in plain english (or your native language)
  - Draw diagrams or doodles
    - A pen-and-paper approach is surprisingly effective
    - Or a whiteboard, or a tablet, as long as its tangible, i.e. not rigid texts

- What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

  - Decide the general appearance, e.g. will it have a user interface or not
  - Identify the inputs to be given
  - Identify the required outputs
  - Break the problem down into several parts
  - Visualize how the inputs may be converted into the outputs
  - Each conversion may constitute a part of the problem itself
  - Create a pseudocode of the logic and step-by-step process to be taken

- What is an algorithm?

  - The step-by-step procedure to achieve a particular goal

- What is pseudocode?

  - An outline of the logic needed to implement a particular algorithm

- What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

  - Bite-sized tackling of problems; not overwhelming
  - Easier to implement small-scale solutions
  - Can be tested with relative ease
  - Modularization of solution, which is good most of the time

# _The Unix Shell: Setup_ progress

https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html

- Downloaded `shell-lesson-data.zip` to `../.exclude`
- [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Already installed. `git` not available on Windows out of the box.
- ~~**WSL/2**~~. WSL1 is apparently clunky. WSL2 not available on my version of Windows üòè. Also, subsystem install will bloat my Windows partition; I already have a dedicated Linux (Zorin) install.

## Commands

- `cd`

  ```bash
  Mark@Experiment MINGW64 01-Setup (main)
  $ cd

  Mark@Experiment MINGW64 ~
  $
  ```

  - Went from `01-Setup` directory to home (`~`) directory.
  - Will remain on dedicated TOP directory for this course though.

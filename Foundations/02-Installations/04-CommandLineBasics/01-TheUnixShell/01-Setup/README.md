# _The Unix Shell: Setup_ progress

https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html

- Downloaded `shell-lesson-data.zip` to `../.exclude`
- [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Already installed. `git` not available on Windows out of the box.
- ~~**WSL/2**~~. WSL1 is apparently clunky. WSL2 not available on my version of Windows üòè. Also, subsystem install will bloat my Windows partition; I already have a dedicated Linux (Zorin) install.

# Text Editors

## Preferred code editors

- ~~**Visual Studio Code**~~. _aka_ VSCodium. Microsoft, proprietary, telemetry.
- [**Codium**](https://vscodium.com/). _aka_ VSCodium. Open-source binary compilation of VSCode.
  - I still use VSCode's [extension marketplace](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md#extensions-marketplace=) though...
- [**Sublime Text 3**](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). Preferred text editor for day-to-day use, e.g. note-taking. Not necessarily for coding / programming. Sometimes used for scripting though!
  - Sublime Text 4 was a bit too buggy on my machine when I last tried it
